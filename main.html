    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with input size. 
        A lower Time complexity generally means the algorithm is more efficient.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        For example, an algorithm that stores all elements might use O(n) space.
